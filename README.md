This repository's sole purpose is to act as an hub so I can easily sync my notes and documents across devices.

## Steps so you can do it yourself

1. Go to Github.com -> Settings -> scroll last -> developer settings

2. Under Personal access token, click `Tokens (classic)` and generate a new token

3. Name the token and set the scope as `repos` only

>! Copy this <i>token</i> as you will not see it again and you will have to generate a new one

4. Now construct a link using the acquired token
`https:<enter-token-string>@github.com/your-username/repo-you-want-to-sync.git`


# **SETUP**
---
If you want to push/pull between mobile devices too, I'd recommend setting up the mobile set-up first 

## For desktop

1. Go to obsidian, install git plug-in.
>! You will probably need git cli for it work


## For Mobile 

I set it up on my android 13 device so I'll guide it as is, but it should work fine too in IOS devices

1. Open Obsidian and install the git plug-in

2. Initialiaze git
