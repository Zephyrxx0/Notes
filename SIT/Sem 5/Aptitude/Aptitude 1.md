$$Area of sector = /360 . 2πR

$$
$$LSA (cube,cuboid) = (l+b)h
$$
$$Volume Of Cylinder = 2πrh
$$
$$Volume of cuboid = lbh
$$
$$BodyDiagonal(cuboid,cube)= l
$$

The sum of the length,breadth and height a cuboid is 96cm and the lenght of the longest diagonal of the cuboid is 15cm, then what is the TSA of the cuboid?
